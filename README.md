## 📖 desc & controls

simple infinite runner type game! basically the same as the "offline chrome browser dino game" but has
- treats you should try to get!!! (green stars 💚😋🎁)
- obstacles you should try to avoid!!! (red stars 💥😡🤕)
- an 8% chance that you will encounter a "colorblind mode" that mimics protanopia

** as per the og chrome dino game, the game speed will increase as your score increases**

🎮 **controls** 🎮
- press any key to start the game (when the game ends, press any key to restart) ▶️
- use the up arrow key ⬆️
- use the down arrow key to duck ⬇️
- if you wanna quit, hit ESC key 🚪🚶

## 🤔 FAQ
- built using PyGame! this is my first finished PyGame project!
- colorblindness effects 8% of men, which is why i chose 8% as the random-chance for the protanopia filter
- oopsin is a pun off opsin: a family of light-sensitive proteins. different types of opsin are sensitive to different wavelengths of light, which lets us see color!
- colorblindness happens when the opsin proteins on the X chromosome have genetic mutations (X-linked inheritance!)
- i am not colorblind! but my friend is... i feel awful when i forget every autumn & try to point out red leaves i think are pretty... sorry buddy... anyway, he started trying to explain to me how HE sees thinks and how he can differentiate based on some contexts. which made me curious and gave me gamey-makey ideas!
